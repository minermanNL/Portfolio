## Detailed Explanation of Features:

### User Authentication:
*   **Flow:** Users can sign up or log in via the frontend forms, which submit to new API routes (`/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`). These routes perform **IP-based rate limiting** and **Cloudflare Turnstile verification** before using Supabase Auth. Upon successful authentication, they gain access to the dashboard.
*   **Mechanism:** Securely managed by Supabase Authentication, with server-side handling in the new API routes.
*   **Security:** **Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile verification** on the backend API routes to mitigate bot signups and login attempts. **IP-based rate limiting** is applied to these routes (`/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`) to prevent abuse like mass account creation or brute-force login attempts from a single IP.
*   **Session Management:** `AuthSessionProvider.tsx` manages the global authentication state, often leveraging Next.js's context or React Query for session freshness. `useAuthSession.ts` provides a convenient hook to access the current user's session and ID across components. Supabase handles session cookies on successful login via the backend API route.

### User Profile:
*   **Access:** Users can view and update their profile details (e.g., `username`, `full_name`, `avatar_url`, `website`).
*   **Data Source:** Profile information is stored in a dedicated `profiles` table within Supabase, linked to `auth.users` via a `user_id` column.
*   **Updates:** Client-side components like `ProfileClient.tsx` handle form submissions, which are securely sent to Supabase via the Supabase JS client.

### Melody Library:
*   **Display:** `MelodyList.tsx` fetches and displays a paginated list of melodies, each presented as a `MelodyCard.tsx`.
*   **Data Source:** Melodies are stored in a `melodies` table in Supabase. This table links to the `tasks` table (for generation history) and `user_id` (for ownership).
*   **Interaction:** Users can search and filter their melodies based on metadata (genre, mood, description).
*   **Playback/Download:** The `MelodyCard` facilitates playback of generated MIDI data (by decoding base64) and provides download options.

### AI Melody Generation:
*   **User Interface:** The primary interaction point is the generation form in `src/app/dashboard/generate/page.tsx` (`MelodyGenerationClient.tsx`).
*   **Asynchronous Flow (Current State: Debugging API Interaction):**
    1.  **Task Initiation (Frontend -> Next.js API Route):**
        *   The user submits a text prompt (e.g., "upbeat piano melody in C major") via `MelodyGenerationClient.tsx`.
        *   The client sends a `POST` request to the Next.js API Route: `/api/generate-melody-task`. **This route is now protected by user-based rate limiting.**
        *   This API Route first creates a new record in the Supabase `public.tasks` table (e.g., `id`, `user_id`, `prompt`, `status: 'PENDING'`) using the `authenticated` user's ID for RLS. This is secured by a specific RLS policy: `"Allow authenticated users to insert their own tasks"`.
        *   The Next.js API Route then immediately returns a `202 Accepted` status with the `taskId` to the frontend, indicating that the task has been queued.
    2.  **AI Processing (Next.js API Route -> Supabase Edge Function -> Supabase DB):**
        *   **Crucially, *after* creating the task in Supabase, the Next.js API Route makes an internal, server-to-server call to your deployed Supabase Edge Function (`generate-melody-tasks`).** It passes the `taskId` and `prompt`.
        *   The Edge Function, running in a Deno environment:
            *   Updates the `tasks` table status to 'PROCESSING' using the `service_role` key (secured by `"Allow service_role to update tasks table"` policy).
            *   Calls the Google AI model (`googleai/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`) via Genkit's `ai.generate()` method. Messages are directly constructed within `ai.generate()` (e.g., `{ role: 'user', content: [{ text: "system prompt + user prompt" }] }`), bypassing `ai.definePrompt`'s templating layer to ensure `content` is never `[null]`.
            *   The AI model returns a raw text string containing MIDI event descriptions.
            *   This raw text string is passed to `src/utils/parseTextToMidi.ts`, which is responsible for converting the text into a playable binary MIDI file and then encoding it to a base64 string.
            *   Finally, the Edge Function updates the `tasks` table to 'COMPLETED' in Supabase, saving the base64 `midi_data` and a generated `description`. If an error occurs during AI generation or processing, the status is set to 'FAILED' with an `error_message`.
    3.  **Frontend Polling & Display (Frontend -> Next.js API Route -> Frontend):**
        *   While the Edge Function processes, `MelodyGenerationClient.tsx` periodically polls the `/api/melody-status/[taskId]` Next.js API route.
        *   This polling route retrieves the current `status` from the `tasks` table in Supabase.
        *   Once the status changes to 'COMPLETED':
            *   The frontend retrieves the `midi_data` (the full base64 string) and `description`.
            *   It decodes the base64 string using `window.atob()` and converts it to a `Uint8Array`.
            *   A `Blob` is created from this binary data, and an object URL is generated.
            *   A temporary link element is used to trigger a file download (`audio.midi` type).
            *   The melody is displayed and made available for playback.
        *   If the status is 'FAILED', the frontend displays the `error_message` from the task record.

#### Subscription Tiers:

*   **Basic Tier**
    *   Monthly Generations: 100
    *   Max Melody Storage: 500 MB
    *   Concurrent Generations: 2
    *   Max API Keys: 5
    *   Advanced Features: True

    *   Concurrent Generations: 5
    *   Max API Keys: 20
    *   Advanced Features: True
    *   API Access: True

### Subscription Management:
*   **Initiation:** The pricing page (`src/app/pricing/page.tsx`) guides users to select a plan.
*   **Checkout Flow:** User selection triggers a request to the `/api/create-stripe-checkout` Next.js API Route. This route securely communicates with Stripe's API to create a unique checkout session. The user is then redirected to Stripe's secure hosted checkout page for payment.
*   **Webhook Processing:** Upon successful payment or subscription changes, Stripe sends real-time webhook events (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`) to the `/api/stripe-webhook` Next.js API Route. This webhook handler includes **Stripe signature verification** for security and updates the `subscriptions` table in Supabase with the user's accurate subscription status, current plan, and billing period.
*   **Status Display:** `SubscriptionClient.tsx` fetches and displays the user's current subscription details from the Supabase `subscriptions` table.
*   **User Portal:** For managing payment methods, updating billing information, or cancelling subscriptions, users are securely redirected to the Stripe customer portal, providing a self-service option.

### UI Components:
*   **Structure:** Components in `src/components/ui/` are built upon a robust UI library (like Shadcn/ui), providing a consistent, accessible, and themeable design system. This includes common elements such as buttons, cards, dialogs, forms, input fields, and navigation elements (menubar, sidebar).
*   **Styling:** The application's visual consistency is maintained through a utility-first approach with **Tailwind CSS**, configured via `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.mjs`. Global styles are managed in `globals.css`.
*   **Turnstile Widget:** Cloudflare Turnstile widget (`<div className="cf-turnstile">`) added to authentication forms (`LoginForm.tsx`, `SignupForm.tsx`), rendered only on the client-side to avoid hydration errors.

### Backend Logic (Next.js API Routes & Supabase Edge Functions):
*   **Supabase:** Serves as the central backend for all data storage (PostgreSQL), user authentication, and file storage.
*   **Next.js API Routes (`/src/app/api/`)**: Act as serverless functions within the Next.js framework. They are used for:
    *   Handling sensitive operations (e.g., communicating with Stripe APIs, creating initial database records).
    *   Orchestrating complex asynchronous workflows by triggering Supabase Edge Functions.
    *   Serving as dedicated endpoints for frontend interaction (e.g., polling for task status). **Many of these routes now include rate limiting.**
*   **Supabase Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/`)**: Deno-based serverless functions deployed globally. They are specifically chosen for:
    *   **AI Model Inference:** Offloading the heavy computation of AI model calls to a dedicated, performable, and scalable environment.
    *   **Long-Running Tasks:** Handling asynchronous operations that might exceed typical API route timeouts.
    *   **Deno Runtime:** Leveraging Deno's modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for secure and efficient execution.

### Development Environment and Tooling:
*   **Google IDX Integration**: The project is developed within Google's IDX, a cloud-based IDE that provides a tightly integrated and powerful development environment.
*   **Unified AI Assistance**: Deep integration of AI coding assistance (powered by **Gemini**), providing intelligent code completion, suggestions, and context-aware help directly within the editor. This spans across the IDX environment and Firebase services.
*   **Multimodal Prompting**: The development environment supports multimodal prompting capabilities, enabling more flexible and expressive interactions when using AI for coding and development tasks.
*   **Enhanced Firebase Integration**: Provides streamlined workflows and tighter integration with Firebase services, complementing Supabase where applicable (e.g., for analytics, specific cloud functions if any are still used, or project management).
*   **Dependency Management**: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` manage NPM dependencies. `tsconfig.json` configures TypeScript. `.idx/dev.nix` is a Nix environment configuration for consistent local development.
*   **MIDI Libraries**: `midi-parser-js` (potentially for MIDI-to-text conversion) and `@tonejs/midi` (for programmatically generating MIDI data in the backend).
*   **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used for input/output validation in API routes, database operations, and Genkit flows.
*   **Upstash Redis (@upstash/redis)**: A serverless Redis provider used for efficient storage and management of rate limiting counts.
*   **Cloudflare Turnstile**: Integrated for bot mitigation on user-facing authentication endpoints.

## üöÄ How It Works (High-Level Flow):

1.  **User Authentication & Access**: A user signs up/logs in via the frontend forms, which submit to new API routes (`/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`). These routes perform **IP-based rate limiting** and **Cloudflare Turnstile verification** before using Supabase Auth. Upon successful authentication, they gain access to the dashboard.
2.  **Subscription & Monetization**:
    *   User selects a plan from the pricing page.
    *   Frontend calls `/api/create-stripe-checkout`.
    *   Next.js API route interacts with Stripe, creates a checkout session, and redirects the user to Stripe's payment portal.
    *   After payment, Stripe sends a webhook to `/api/stripe-webhook`.
    *   The Next.js webhook handler verifies the Stripe signature and updates the Supabase `subscriptions` table.
    *   The user's subscription status is displayed in `SubscriptionClient.tsx`.
3.  **AI Melody Generation (Asynchronous & Event-Driven)**:
    *   The user provides a text prompt in `MelodyGenerationClient.tsx` and initiates generation.
    *   **Frontend Request to Next.js API:** `MelodyGenerationClient.tsx` sends a `POST` request with the prompt to `/api/generate-melody-task`. **This route is now protected by user-based rate limiting.**
    *   **Next.js API Task Creation:** `/api/generate-melody-task` generates a `taskId`, saves a 'PENDING' task record in the Supabase `tasks` table, and immediately returns the `taskId` to the frontend.
    *   **Next.js API Triggers Edge Function:** `/api/generate-melody-task` then makes a background server-to-server call to the **Supabase Edge Function** (`generate-melody-tasks`), passing the `taskId` and prompt.
    *   **Edge Function Processing (Genkit Core)**:
        *   The Edge Function updates the task status to 'PROCESSING' in Supabase.
        *   It constructs messages (including system and user prompts) and calls Genkit's `ai.generate()` using the specified Google AI model (e.g., `googleai/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`).
        *   The model returns raw MIDI event text.
        *   This text is passed to `parseTextToMidi.ts`, which uses `@tonejs/midi` to convert the text into a full binary MIDI file, then base64 encodes it.
        *   The Edge Function updates the task status to 'COMPLETED' in Supabase, saving the base64 `midi_data` and a generated `description`. If an error occurs during AI generation or processing, the status is set to 'FAILED' with an `error_message`.
    *   **Frontend Polling & Display**:
        *   While the Edge Function processes, `MelodyGenerationClient.tsx` periodically polls the `/api/melody-status/[taskId]` Next.js API route.
        *   This API route fetches the latest status from the Supabase `tasks` table.
        *   Once the status is 'COMPLETED', the frontend retrieves the full base64 `midi_data` and `description`. It then decodes the base64 data, creates a playable MIDI object (e.g., a Blob or AudioBuffer), and updates the UI with playback controls, visualization, and the description.
        *   If 'FAILED', an error message is displayed.
4.  **Melody Management:** Users can view their generated melodies in the dashboard library.
5.  **Iteration/Refinement:** (Assumed to be a POST to `/api/melody-status/[taskId]`). **This endpoint is now protected by user-based rate limiting.** (Note: Actual iteration logic needs to be implemented).
6.  **Tools and Future Expansion:** Advanced features and vocal generation are planned for future development.

## üöß Work Done & Remaining Tasks (Rate Limiting, Abuse Protection, Turnstile):

### ‚úÖ Completed:

*   Created core rate limiting configuration (`src/config/rate-limits.ts`), service logic (`src/services/rate-limiter.ts`), and IP utility (`src/lib/get-ip.ts`).
*   Integrated Upstash Redis (`src/lib/redis.ts`) as the data store for rate limits.
*   Implemented user-based hourly and daily rate limits for the MIDI generation endpoint (`/api/generate-melody-task`).
*   Added a placeholder `POST` handler to `/api/melody-status/[taskId]/route.ts` and applied user-based hourly and daily rate limiting to it (assuming this is the iteration endpoint).
*   Refactored frontend signup (`SignupForm.tsx`) to submit to a new backend API route (`/api/auth/signup`).
*   Created the backend API route for signup (`/api/auth/signup`).
*   Refactored frontend login (`LoginForm.tsx`) to submit to a new backend API route (`/api/auth/login`).
*   Created the backend API route for login (`/api/auth/login`).
*   Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile widget into `SignupForm.tsx` and `LoginForm.tsx`.
*   Added the Cloudflare Turnstile loading script to the authentication layout (`src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`).
*   Implemented server-side Cloudflare Turnstile verification in the `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/login` API routes.
*   Implemented IP-based hourly and daily rate limits for the signup (`/api/auth/signup`) and login (`/api/auth/login`) API routes.
*   Resolved hydration errors caused by the Turnstile widget by rendering it client-side using `useEffect`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Remaining (Minimum Scope to be fully functional):

*   **Testing and Verification:** Thoroughly test all implemented rate limits (user/IP, hourly/daily configured via environment variables) and Turnstile integrations on signup and login pages in both development and a deployed environment.
*   **Implement Iteration Logic:** Replace the `TODO` comment in the `handleIterationPost` function in `src/app/api/melody-status/[taskId]/route.ts` with the actual backend logic for performing melody refinement/iteration.
*   **Environment Variables:** Ensure all necessary environment variables (especially for rate limits, Redis, and Turnstile) are correctly set in your deployment environment (e.g., Vercel project settings).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Production Checklist / Development-Specific ToDos:

*   **Replace Cloudflare Turnstile Test Keys:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables are currently using **Cloudflare provided test keys (`1x0000...`)**. **These MUST be replaced** with the actual Site Key and Secret Key generated from your Cloudflare dashboard for your production domain before deploying to production.
*   **Configure Redis in Production Environment:** Ensure the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` environment variables are correctly set in your production environment (e.g., Vercel project settings) to point to your live Upstash Redis instance.
*   **Set Production Rate Limit Environment Variables:** Configure the specific rate limit environment variables (e.g., `MIDI_GEN_HOURLY_LIMIT_PER_USER`, `ACCOUNT_CREATION_DAILY_LIMIT_PER_IP`, etc.) in your production environment with the desired limits for your live application.
*   **Enhance Logging:** While basic console logging is in place, consider implementing more robust, structured logging integrated with a centralized logging system for better monitoring and debugging in a production environment.

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Future Enhancements (Beyond Minimum Scope):

*   **Sophisticated Abuse Detection:** Implement more advanced techniques for detecting account cycling or other complex abuse patterns (e.g., device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis).
*   **Fallback for JS Disabled:** Provide an alternative authentication flow or a clear message for users with JavaScript disabled who cannot render/complete the Turnstile challenge.
*   **Admin Interface for Limits:** Create an admin interface to manage rate limits dynamically instead of solely relying on environment variables.
